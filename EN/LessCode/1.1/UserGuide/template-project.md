## APP Template Usage Guide

The Blueking LessCode (LessCode) offers APP-level templates such as official website templates, backend management templates, and announcement templates. These templates include complete APP functionalities like functions, variables, and databases. You can directly create a new APP based on these templates without assembling from scratch, and simply modify the corresponding content to quickly complete the APP development.
