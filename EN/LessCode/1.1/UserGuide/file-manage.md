# File Management Usage Guide

File management is used to upload file resources needed in the APP, such as images and documents. Once uploaded, you will receive an access link that can be used for displaying or downloading on the page.

## File Upload

Navigate to the "Resource Management - File Management" page and click the "Upload" button to select the file you want to upload.

## Using Files on the Page

In the page editor, common components like images or carousels can easily utilize images. Drag the component onto the canvas and use the right-side properties panel to click "Select Image," which opens the file management dialog.
