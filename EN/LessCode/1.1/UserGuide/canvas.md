# Canvas Editing

The canvas editing page is roughly divided into four areas: the material area, the drag area, the toolbar, and the properties/styles/events configuration panel.

- Based on design drafts or prototypes, drag materials from the material area to the canvas drag area for arrangement.
- After selecting a component, you can use the blue icons above the component or shortcuts to copy, paste, delete, save as a template, and perform other quick operations.

## Properties/Styles/Events Configuration Panel

After selecting a component, you can configure the properties/styles/events/instructions of the current component.

During the configuration process, if you need to use variables or functions, you can configure the necessary variables or functions through the toolbar entry first. For specific usage, please refer to the guide on using functions and variables on the canvas.

## Toolbar

Includes entry points for saving pages as templates, clearing pages, viewing page source code/JSON, setting functions, setting variables, using shortcut key guides, canvas guides, saving, previewing the canvas, and more.

## In addition, when no component is selected on the page (or click the settings icon next to the preview button), the right area will display the overall configuration of the page.

You can modify the basic configuration of the page, route configuration, style configuration.
